# My-TODOs
Usually I use `Google Keep` to keep track of my ToDos and reading lists. But lists are getting bigger and unable manage. So, I deciede to use Gihub projects to make more efficient tracking to my ToDos which includes
1. Devlopment Related - creation of tools, fixes, issue tracking
2. Blog Post - new ideas, typos, new posts
3. Reading List - Links, ebooks, etc to gain knowledge
4. POCs - Learn new tools

Goto [`projects`](https://github.com/veerendra2/My-TODOs/projects) tab to find more.
